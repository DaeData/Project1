**Testing a Perceptual Phenomenon**


The Stroop Effect was developed by John Ridley Stroop. In the Stroop study, subjects are shown a list of words, each in a different color of ink. This study is measured in two ways. In the first measurement(condition), the subjects are first given a list where the color of the word matches the word. The second measurement(condition) differs in that the color of ink and the word do not match.

The independent variable in the study is the color/word association. The dependent variable is time in seconds it takes the subject to speak the proper word.

In this study, we are predicting(hypothesis) how the population would respond to the test based on our results of the 24 subjects(sample) in this study. Because the subjects are the same for the two tests, a paired sample (dependent) t-test will be performed. We use a t-test because our population Standard Deviation is not known, and our sample size is less than 30.
